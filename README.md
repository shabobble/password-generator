# Password Generator

Third week's homework for UNH Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp

## Description

The goal of this project was to modify some provided code to create a password generator application. Our main tasks were to ensure that:

* Clicking the "Generate Password" button initiates a series of prompts for password criteria

* These prompts allow the user to select which characters they would like including in their password

* The user is prompted to provide a number for the length of their password between 8 and 128 characters in such a way that a number less than 8, greater than 128, or a non-number will not be accepted

* When all prompts have been confirmed or denied, a password fitting the provided criteria is generated and printed into the text box on the screen

## Built with

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
